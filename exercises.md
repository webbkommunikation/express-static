### 1

Create an express server which has one route `GET /welcome`. This route will return a welcome message.
Next, create a simple frontend which will display the same message as `GET /welcome`. The message should be fetched from the express route.

### 2

Now add an array to your express server called `fruits`. This is simply a list of different fruits such as `fruits = ["Banana", "Apple", "Pear]`.

- Create an appropiate route for returning all the fruit.
- Create a frontend which lists all the fruit.

### 3

Add capability to add a new fruit to the list. You will need to create a new route on the backend, and create some sort of form on the frontend.
